# Week 1: Focused vs Diffused

	2 modes of thinking: 
		focused: concentrated  
		diffuse mode: relaxed
		When u are learnign something new, your mind needs to go between the two modes of thinking. Dali used to hold a key slightly above the floor and relax in his chair until he falls asleep: the key falls and the noise wakes him up, and he gathers the thought. Edison used to have a similar techniques.
		You are either in one or the other, just like a coin

	Metaphor and analogies are really helpful

	Do a little everyday: the brain is a muscle, just like you would not do a bodybuilding training in one session, need a lil everyday. Because good learning is difficult.


	Brain typically weighs 3 lbs, but consume more energy per pound than the rest of the body. Most complex device in the universe. Brain connectivity is dinamyc and changes even after one is mature. There are a million billion synapses (connections), where memory is stored. They are less than a micron in diameter (human hair is 20 micron). So you are not the same person, even after a sleep. Those synapses are formed on the dendrites of neurons when you learn something new

	When you look at something you rather not do, your brain thinks about pain. So your brain tries to distract you. But when you stick in, the pain disappears. The pomodoro technique: Set a timer to 25 min, allow no interruption, get yourself to focus, and give yourself a reward at the end (e.g. mental relaxation).

	Why are Math so challening: abstract nature of the idea might be why. E.g. a cow is a very precise thing. Same thing for words, like love, zest, hope: well they are related to emotions, so repetition is important. THe more abstract, the more important the repetition is important to build and strengthen the neuropattern. Practice makes permanent. Alternating the diffuse and the focused way allows the brain to circle back and solidify what you are learning.

	Memory: Long term, vs working memory. The two types are related. THe WM is centered on the prefontal cortex. USed to beleive it was 7 chuncks, but it's now thought to be 4. WM is a bad blackboard, but a bad one so you need to repeat thing. To put something in LTM, you have to revisit it at least a few times. This allow things to go from WM to LTM. So you want to use space repetition. Monday, Tuesday, thursday, etc. This gives time for the mortar to dry.

	While you are awake, your brain acumulates metabolic toxins. So when you sleep your brain cells shrink, there is more space between your brain cells and this seems to allow toxins to be washed out. It also seems like during sleeps, your brain strenghten areas that you want to remember and erases the other less important memories.

	Dr Terrence Sejnowski interview: Learning by doing, also asking questions kind of breaks the flow. He gets his work done in the evening primarely. The textbooks say that all neurons are created at birth, and knowledge just generates connections between them. People have found that in the hippocampus, new nourons are born every day. Exercise also helps tremendously in that creation. For test taking, don't get hung up, move to another question. Also success doesn't come from being smart. Lots of smart not successful. Passion and persistence (staying the course) is the most important quality for success.

	Dr Robert Bilder: Learning is a little painful. OCEAN: Openess, Consciousness, Extravertedness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Surprisingly, Dr B found that people who are less agreeable tend to show higher rate of achievement.

	Dr Benny the Irish Polygot: learning a new language in 3 months. Worse reason to learn language for the wrong reasons: show off, impress, pick up girls. You need a passion for the language, the culture. Children do it right: they are not perfectionist, they allow themselves to make mistakes, stumbles, play games with it. In the real world you can make mistakes, and realize that people are friendly. Self-defeating prophecies: I cannot learn because I'm too old for it. You probably should learn outside of the country before you go in the country to experience the culture itself. 


# Week 2: Chunks

	Chunks are compacts packages of info that your brain uses. They are pieces of info (from a neuroscience pov) that are bound together thru use and mining.  Chunks are mental interleaving that pulls the new concept bits and pieces into one thing. Set of neurons synthesizing key actions. They are pieces of information bound together into one conception chunk, easy to remember. To embed things in, you need that focused learning, along with diffused (videos). To gain experise, you have to create conceptual chunks. The path to expertise is built little by little: small chunks into large ones

	How do you make a chunk? Like learning a song, you learn a piece of it, then another passage, then join them gradually. Making complex ideas into second-nature execution is what this is all about. Like learning in math, you are pulling sample problems. Be careful not thinking only about why an individual step, but connecting to the big thing. Like learning how to get somewhere in Maps. Pay attention not only to what the directions are saying, but what's happening around you, and soon you can get there yourself.

	Also to make a chunk is different a little on discipline. Let's talk about chunks of mental ideas. 

		First *focus your undivided attention on what you want to chunk*. TV in background, phone checking, etc., would disrupt you. Your working memory only has so many spots.  When you are creating a chunk, you are building new neural patterns and connecting them to existing ones
		Second: Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk. Figure out what the main idea is. Just understanding though does not easily create a chunk. a AH-HA is not expertise. You have to review it afterwards. Closing a book and testing whether you yourself can solve the problem. You have to do it yourself.
		Third: Practice to gain context to see not only how, but when to use that. This is done thru practice. THe context comes when the bottom up of the learning (chunking) meets the Top down of learning (big picture). This is why you usually want to glance at pictures and section headings


	Illusions of competence: Don't reread things to memorize thing. use recall instead: look away and recall as much as possible. And then reread again. Practicing and recall, u learn far more and at a deeper level. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, as if it's creating hooks. Concept mapping is not as good. Rereading is helpful if you let some time pass by (as in spaced repetition). Highlighting and underlying should be kept at an extreme minimum, you get illusion of learning. Words in the margins that synthesize ideas? Better. Testing is a helpful way to make sure you are grasping an idea. Makign a mistake is really good. Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study is even better, you become independent from the cues. Test yourself frequently: recall is a form of minitesting. 

	Motivation:  Acetylcholine: chemical produced by aceth.. neurons. Deals with focused learning and attention. Dopamine controls our motivation. They are part of a large brain of system controlling reward learning. Loss of dopamine leads to decreased motivation, further loss: lethargy, catatonia. Serontonin: usually the alpha-male has more of them in monkeys. Higher risk-taking with lower serotonin. 

	Value of library of chunks. Sequential steps by step where each step leads to solution comes from focused mode. Intuition, which are not always correct. Chunks can help you learn through a process called transfer

	Overlearning: Practicing over and over again, after you mastered what you can in the session is called overleaning. It can be useful when learning piano, etc. Practicing 70 hours for a 20min talk. Be careful focusing on one technique over and over. You might use the wrong tool. Also it might make you overconfident, even though you are narrowly targeting. Einstellung (installation): an inital thought or pattern is anchored in  your brain and prevent a better pattern to be put in, as if a roadblock has been installed. Inital ideas can be misleading. Practice jumping back and forth between different problems or techniques that require different approaches: interleaving. Mix your learning, skipping around through pbs in different chapters. It seem to make your learning more difficult, but actually helping. Interleaving brings flexibility + creativity. Thomas Kuhn: more paradigms changes are brought by young people, or people who deal with various disciplines. Or as they say: science progrresses one funeral at a time, as people stukc on one way to do things die off. 

	
	From Scott Young interview: learn and synthesize things and speak as if you are teaching, and when you realize there are areas you have to be vague about, that's where you should focus. Also create vivid examples the more abstract things are: simple analogies, metaphors. Set exciting goals.



# Week 3: Procrastination and Memory

	One good tool to fight procrastination is the pomodoro. Procrastination is impactful, because you cannot leave things to the last minutes (25min concentrated creative energized focus).

	Learning to avoid procrastination is important because good learning is bit by bit. Procrastination and willpower are somewhat

	Ig you think something that you don't like, your brain center moves off to something else. Procrastination is an influential habit that impacts other areas. Proc. offers temporarily relief. Dealing with proc. is like how those Germans drank a double dose of poisonous arsenic: by getting their body used to little by little doses.

	Chunking is related to habits. 
		Habits have 4 parts: 
					1- the cue, the trigger that launches you into zombie mode: see a text message, open the book. What we do in reaction to that is what matters. 
					2- Routine: this is what the response is to that cue. 
					3- The reward: every habit develops and continue because of the reward. Finding ways to reward good study habits is important to reward procrastination. 
					4- The belief: Habits have power because of your beliefs in them. To change ur habits, change your underlining beliefs.

	Use mental tools and tricks to inspire yourself. A few negative feelings is ok, the way you handle them is what matters. Telling yourself "quit wasting your time and get on, you will feel better soon" when u start the task. Another way is to focus on the process, and not the product: you should think "I'm going to spend 20min working". So you want to avoid concentrating on products. Processes are habits that you should focus on. Avoid focusing on the answers to the question. That is what causes you to procrastination. Who cares if you finish the work or get the answers to that question, the only thing is effort, such as a 25min pomodoro. It is easier because the process is about the brain mindlessly doing something, so it's a less painful. The main thing is to let distractions roll by and to stick through.

	The trick to overwriting a habit is to change your reaction to a cue. The cue  is usually linked to location, time, how you feel, and reactions. You can do a small change: if you get a cue, ignoring it for just a moment. The routine: you could do one like disconnecting ur internet as a habit, or leaving phoen in the car. Just don't try to change it all at once. The rewards: can u give urself one. Beliefs: that your new system could work. Hang out with MOOC-mates/classmates with like-minded people

	Research has shown that writing your todo before you go to sleep is important. Otherwise they take valuable real estate in ur brain. Do a daily task list, along with a weekly one. A few items may be product oriented, because they are quick, but be process oriented. Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your starting time. Many wildly successful MIT students have obtained their PhDs, while stopping work at 5PM. Research shows that balancing pleasurable time with hard work leads to much more success. Also try to work on most important and most disliked task first in the day. At least for 25min. Watch for procrastination cues

	Make images to remember things. Images connect directly to your brain's right hemisphere. The funnier and more evocative image, the better. That image then should be repeated, so it is launched into memory. Repeat sporadically into several days. Then say those things aloud to have the auditory hooks set in ur brain. Then briefly repeat them before sleep. Sleep is when thigns set up in memory.


	Memories are not fixed. Whenever you recall a memory it settles actually. It does not matter if that memory is false. In addition to neurons, brains have glio cells, along with tthe astrocytes which provide nutrients to neurons, maitnain extracullular ion balance (outside the cell), and are involved in repair after an injury.

	Group things into things so you can remember them easily. Memory palace are when you used a familiar place, along with vivid images of what you wish to remember. This is proven to speed up acquisition of things. The memory process becomes an exercise in creativity.


# Week 4: Renaissance Learning

	Two tips: physical exercise. Practice can repair, but this takes much longer once one passes the critical period. Metaphors and analogies are powerful in helping you remember. There is a greater understanding in one's mind constructing the pattern and meaning rather than someone telling you. Being intelligent sometime equate to having a large working memory, but it also makes it difficult to be creative: old ideas take space and prevent new ideas from being created. OTOH a small working memory (distracted) leads to a more creative mind. Remember that deliberate practice in the harder, complicated area, makes you smarter.
 
	Nobel Prize winner Cajal who worked with people smarter than him. The key to my success, coming out of jail, was my perseverance, a virtue of the less brilliant. This was couple with his flexible ability to change his mind and admit errors. Much like Cajal, Darwin was a poor student in school. What yo ulearn though a single teacher or a book is a partial representation of the truth. Taking responsibility of your learning is what will teach you more.

	Don't underestimate the power of team: it is easier to be questioned and figure out what you are missing. Explaining helps build your own understanding too. It also help in networking. But if your studies sessions are turning into socializing, not so good. I

	Testing has a wonderful way to focus your mind. For tests, use the Hard Start - Jump to Easy technique. Start with the hard problems, and once you are stuck for a minute or so, skip a move to an easier one. Another test is that in panicking for a moment during the test, what is important is the justification to the panic. If panic comes in, work on your breathing

	It is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts.
	Just as you can practice lifting weights and get bigger muscles over time, you can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in your mind.
	Whether your naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an imposter. That it's a fluke when you happen to do well on a test, and then on the next test, for sure they, and your family and friends, are finally going to figure out how incompetent you really are. 

	This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name. The Imposter Syndrome. If you suffer from these kinds of feelings of inadequacy just be aware that many others secretly share them.

	Everyone has different gifts, as the old saying goes, when one door closes, another opens. Keep your chin up and your eye on the open door. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.



REMEMBER To switch from Focused to Diffused, strengthening chuncking, adopting tiny changes such as the Pomodoro technique. This course about the learning process, not the product. Teach these ideas to others, and it will help you settle it in your mind. Passion can broaden and grow.
