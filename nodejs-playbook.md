Javascript, then node, then exress, then kraken

## Javascript:
    - Use Typescript
    - https://www.quora.com/How-much-JavaScript-should-I-know-in-order-to-learn-Node-js:
        - Better understand important concepts in javascript like scope, event driven programming, async, callback, design patterns will help you to write better code.
        - You should know these concepts before moving to Node.js -
            1) Javascript Objects
            2) Variables Scopes and hoisting
            3) Closures
            4) Event Loops
        - Another
            1) Fundamentals of js - variables, function, loop, condition, arrays, scope
            2) Callback functions.
            3) Event handling
        - Another
            1)  understand how the node module system works
            2) It's mostly an integration game most of the time. E.g. wiring together web request and response objects, writing some database access code, etc. 
             There's really not a whole lot there that is particularly deep.
            3) Probably the biggest challenge is getting comfortable with using promises, learning the various APIs, and figuring out how to get everything working together using grunt
            4) With those things in place, it is then a matter of using karma, mocha, and chai to get some tasty test harnesses in place so you can rapidly iterate and try out your code.
